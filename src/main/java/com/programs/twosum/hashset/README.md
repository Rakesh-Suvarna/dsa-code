Problem
Given an array of unique integers, numbers, and an integer targetSum, return two numbers from the array so that they add up to targetSum. If there are no pairs with the required targetSum in the input array, then return null.

For example, for array input [3, 6, 10, 14] and targetSum = 9, it should return [3, 6] or [6, 3].

If the array is null or the length is less than two, it should return null.

In the case of an array where a pair with a sum equal to targetSum does not exist, it should return null.
