**Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Difficulty: Medium**

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

**Qn-2: Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**
**Description**
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most 2 distinct characters.

Example
Example 1
Input: “eceba”
Output: 3
Explanation:
T is "ece" which its length is 3.
Example 2
Input: “aaa”
Output: 3



**Qn-3: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
Description**
Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters.

Example
Example 1:

Input: S = "eceba" and k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "eceb"
Example 2:

Input: S = "WORLD" and k = 4
Output: 4
Explanation: T = "WORL" or "ORLD"
